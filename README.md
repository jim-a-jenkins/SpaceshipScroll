Hyperspace Runner 

This is a 2D scrolling game where the objective is to get to the finish line while avoiding enemies. If your ship is struck 3 times, you explode! The game is written in Java using Android Studio.

This game is based on a game called Tappy Defender by John Horton in his book Android Game Programming by Example. The game has been thoroughly modified with the following edits:

- when shields are depleted, explosion graphics occur and ship disappears
- enemy ships also explode
- while boosting, flames shoot out of the ships tailpipe
- while boosting, the stars begin to stretch as if entering hyperspace
- once the game is over, enemies no longer strike your ship

If you have any questions about the game, feel free to reach out to me.
